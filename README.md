# hello-world
First repository on GitHub

I'm someone who wants to use GitHub to improve his programming skills (especially Java)
by working on a small text-based RPG from different locations, like my home computer,
my notebook, or my working station in my freetime at work.

Hope I will be successful and don't get bored or demoralized too fast.
